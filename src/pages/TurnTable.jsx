            This system has been running for a few months on the prototype rig
            shown below. Feed back from their members have gone into development
            of the production version and will be available in the near future.

            The system does feature connections for reversible track power, but
            this current version of the hardware does not yet provide an
            interface method from the circuit to tracks on the bridge. The
            intent is there will be various versions of the system that will
            interface with common turntable platforms, a generic version that
            will allow interface to custom or less common systems and a third
            version that will allow the user to design/install their own method
            by way of a pancake or slip ring encoder for example

            The 5th button board is a programming board (red LED), press and

            turn table 0.1째, 1째, 5째 and 20째 respectively, direction is reversed
            depending on head/tail LED status. To store the position to a button
            board, press and hold desired button for 2 secconds. These values
            are stored on the baord through power cycles, programming board can
            be disconnected or stored under the layout/out of the way.
